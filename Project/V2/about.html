        <article>
            <h2 class="heading1">RESOLUTE MYSTIC v2</h2>
            <div class="subheading">5/4/2021 7:39pm, Joshua Sparks</div>
            <p>
                I have added two new pages with this iteration, the new photography page and the easter egg page. The easter egg page is only available through the about page 
                through the sidebar, just click the 'want to see an ugly page?' link. The easter egg page serves as a place for me to experiment with things and have some fun. I'll be adding more content to that page, though
                sadly I can't add hidden content without talking about it here on the about page update log.
            </p>
            <p>
                For overall changes, I made it so the side bar on ALL pages are now fixed position, so it will follow the viewport through scrolling. I may revert this at a
                later date. If you are thinking of reviewing this website, please tell me if you think the following sidebar is a good idea or not!
            </p>
            <p>
                Otherwise, the photography page was fun to make and I think it looks nice. It looks practically how I made it with the wireframe. The most useful thing I learned
                this module is definitely the grid technique, it makes creating a carefully laid out content article or even an entire page quite easy. I was considering
                rewriting my entire code to include a grid as the base layout, but I decided it's too much work and how I've done it so far is just fine.

            <div class="subheading">4/22/2021 1:21am, Joshua Sparks</div>
            <p>I have finally gotten these pages to how I want them to look in a general sense.</p>
            <p>
                As a general layout, the front page serves as a landing page with navigation to all planned and current sites. The navbar is consistent through all pages, and I have
                established this layout you are seeing as a template for the rest of the site pages. The front page may serve as a general blog, each article shows a different
                card-like structure that houses a heading and subheading. The subheading, as used here, can be used as an author name, date, and time marker.
            </p>
            <p>
                I managed to get this card-like layout by setting the background color to be black and then coloring each element white, then applying copious amounts of margin and padding
                properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sidebar will change throughout the pages, but at the moment it serves as a secondary navbar on the front page that houses a link to the about page as well as a
                few youtube videos.
            </p>
            <p>
                By far the most annoying thing to get working was the header and header image. It took me about five hours straight of just fiddling with it to manage to get it in place.
                It does use positioning and float properties not yet taught in the class, something that I did not know was discouraged until after the fact. Good job, me.
                The footer will have more things in it at some point, at the moment it just serves as a link back to the top of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may notice that links look like buttons when you hover over them. By applying the hover property of links in order to change the background color and text
                color of said link as you hover over it, you can make it look like a box-like object within the navbar or wherever the link is placed by adding padding around the link.
                This also makes the link area itself bigger and easier to click on. I think it looks nice, and hope to see this trick used in the other sites!

        <!--
            I know I am using the link button class that is designated for the sidebar,
            I am too lazy to rename it and it is useful outside of it's intended purpose.
            The font size is too small for a button class, too, so it is staying as
            'sidelinkbutton' for now.
