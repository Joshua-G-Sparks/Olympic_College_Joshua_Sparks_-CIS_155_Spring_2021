            <div class="subheading">4/22/2021 6:26pm, Joshua Sparks</div>
            <p>
                This will be the main page of this website, serving as a general blog area that I will post whatever to. I may have to optimize this later by
                having these cards be previews of full length articles that will inhabit their own page, which will in turn make things easier to navigate.
                This may also include using the sidebar for article navigation, which I like the idea of.
            </p>
            <p>
                The about page will serve as a real development log. Also, don't mind the filler below, it is so I could test the 'jump to top of page' button
                in the footer, and so you could too. Try it out, it's a somewhat common part of websites like these.
            </p>
            <p>
                My question is if I should increase or reduce the paragraph margin on these article cards. By increasing the margin they will span less of
                the width of the card as a whole. By reducing or removing the margin, the paragraph will take up the entire card. I think leaving the margin
                there will allow for other content to be placed later, such as asides or images.

        <!--
            Lots of filler content above, this is so that I am able to use the id link that jumps to the top of the page, as described below.
            Will be removed and replaced with real content as it comes.
        -->

    <footer>
        <a href="#top" class="sidelinkbutton">jump to top of page</a>
        <!--
            I know I am using the link button class that is designated for the sidebar,
            I am too lazy to rename it and it is useful outside of it's intended purpose.
            The font size is too small for a button class, too, so it is staying as
            'sidelinkbutton' for now.

            PS: This link SHOULD bring the user to the top of the page when there is
            enough content on the page to create a scroll bar, to test this i will add
            more test articles in content div

            PPS: Link worked, will leaving sufficient filler material so it can be tested.
